-> why js is not multithreaded
	just to be simple


->What is libuv?
	libuv` is an open-source library that provides support for asynchronous I/O based operations. 
	Event Loop, asyc IO, thread poo


------ worker threads ------
used to run task of multiple thread in nodejs runtime.

----- web worker in browser ----------
Web Workers are super useful in web browsers because they let you run heavy or time-consuming tasks in the background without freezing the user interface.



------ service worker --------------
A Service Worker is a special type of JavaScript script that runs in the background of your browser, separate from the web page. It acts like a programmable network proxy, giving you control over how network requests from your web app are handled. runs even after tab is closed independent page lifecycle.



---- flutter frontend rendering and other topics -------- *** skia rendering engine platform independent

*** Flutter renders UI by drawing every pixel itself using Skia, independent of the platform's native UI widgets.
has below threads


UI Thread (Main Thread) running dart code
Raster Thread (GPU Thread) responsible for rendering the UI on the screen.
Platform Thread Manages communication between Flutter and the underlying OS (Android/iOS).

 *** isolates are used to offload work from main thread

----------- React js -----------------
steps how react page renders
	1) browser downloads src file and parses the code.
	2) react starts building the dom(first virtual dom and builds real dom) and modifies dom
	3) browser uses rendering engines to display the dom(blink or webkit)

***** how virtual dom works in react js

on any change react builds virtual dom first, and uses as diffing algorithm to find the minimal changes and modifies the real dom
efficiently. so these is the reason its faster.

-------------- Polyfills -------------
a peice of code writing to enable support of certian features in older js browsers



 ------------- vue.js -----------------
 vue was designed to be a simple verison of react and angular bringin reactiity and good seperation of logic beween ui and logic unlike React	
 
 vue also uses virtual dome like react though there are minor differnts


 -------------- async vs defer-------------
these are the keywords used to tell browser how to load scirpt file.

without anyKeyword: browser pauses html parsign as soon as it encouters script tag and will load the script
with async: scrit is loaded paraller when encountedd.
withe deferL srcipt is loaded after html parsing is done.



--------------- scope and gloabal object in js --------


---------------prototype,prottycpal chain and inheritince =====
every object in js has an internal property prototype which refers to a parent object of parent data type object.
prototyle chain is that if we access a method or property of an object it will go all parent object and return the value or method.



--------------- Es6 vs Commonn js modules -----------------
common js modules are the native modules for js. es6 introduced to provide support in browsers


-------------- js strict mode---------
It helps catch common coding bugs and makes JavaScript safer and cleaner.
